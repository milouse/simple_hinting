# Simple Hinting

Allow keyboard browsing through links hinting.

This addons displays small green numbered labels next to the links of
the current page when you press `Alt + Shift`.

If you enter one of the displayed numbers, followed by a special
keycode, you'll be redirected to the link target, either directly or by
opening a new window or tab.

The keycodes are the following:

- `f` (*follow*), browse in current tab;
- `t` (*tab*), open in a new tab;
- `w` (*window*), open either a new window or a new tab, following your
  browser preference.

At any time, pressing `c` or pressing again `Alt + Shift` will cancel
the link selection and remove all green labels.
