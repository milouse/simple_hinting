# Simple Hinting

Allow keyboard browsing through links hinting.

This addon is available on
[AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-hinting/).

It displays small green numbered labels next to the links of the current
page when you press `Alt + Space`.

If you enter one of the displayed numbers, followed by a special
keycode, you'll be redirected to the link target, either directly or by
opening a new window or tab.

The keycodes are the following:

- `f` (*follow*), browse in current tab;
- `t` (*tab*), open in a new tab;
- `w` (*window*), open either a new window;
  browser preference.
- `i` (*incognito*) or `p` (*private*), open in a new private window.

At any time, pressing `c` or `Esc` will cancel the link selection and
remove all green labels.
